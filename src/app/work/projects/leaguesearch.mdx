## Overview

Search up summoners in Riot's hit game League of Legends. Built with React and Express.

## Key Features

- **Simplicity**: Developed and generated all used assets with a single enter of a player's name.
- **Interactive**: Any icon expands into a tooltip detailing the item, spell or champion.
- **Calculations**: Raw data converted into easily consumable data to help improve gameplay.

## Technologies Used

- **Riot API**: For source of truth.
- **Express.js**: For sending data requests.
- **React.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Bootstrap**: For managing styles dynamically using design tokens.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was consuming the sheer amount of data the Riot api had. Decisions had to be made on how to make data more easily consumed at a glance.

## Outcome

This mainfested into small details such as kill death ratios exceeding 3 to be yellow, and under 1 to be red. Datestamps exceeding 60mins would turn into hours and or days, and icons assigned dynamically depending on
lane positions, champion played, and mastery tier.
