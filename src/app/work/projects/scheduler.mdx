## Overview

Development of a flexible and highly customizable design system using React.js for front-end and Jest, Cypress and Storybook for testing.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable UI components using React and styled-components, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Theming and Customization**: Integrated a theming system that allows easy switching and customization of color palettes, typography, and layout styles using CSS variables.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation with Storybook to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Axios**: For creating api calls.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **Storybook**: For building an interactive, documented component library.
